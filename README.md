# OpenZeppelin's Ethernaut Challenges Solution
Welcome to my repository for the solutions to OpenZeppelin's Ethernaut challenges. In this repository, I will be sharing my thought process and solutions to each challenge as I progress through the levels.

## About the Ethernaut Challenges
Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based game developed by OpenZepplin that features a number of smart contract hacking challenges. The objective of the game is to educate 
you about smart contract security by making you work to identify and take advantage of smart contract flows.

The challenges include a variety of security issues, such as improper fallback implementation, naming issues, reentrancy attact, etc.
It begins with basic challenges and progresses in difficulty as you continue.
